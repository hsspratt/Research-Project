abstract = {Written from the perspective of an experimental chemist, this book puts together some fundamentals from chemistry, solid state physics and quantum chemistry, to help with understanding and predicting the electronic and optical properties of organic semiconductors, both polymers and small molecules. The text is intended to assist graduate students and researchers in the field of organic electronics to use theory to design more efficient materials for organic electronic devices, such as organic solar cells, light emitting diodes and field effect transistors. After addressing some basic topics in solid state physics, a comprehensive introduction to molecular orbitals and band theory leads to a description of computational methods based on Hartree-Fock and density functional theory (DFT), for predicting geometry conformations, frontier levels and energy band structures. Topological defects and transport and optical properties are then addressed, and one of the most commonly used transparent conducting polymers, PEDOT:PSS, is described in some detail as a case study.},

abstract = {As high-throughput combinatorial experimental methods become more common, the technical challenge is shifting from producing materials to dealing with increasingly large datasets. One of the most important metrics to determine suitability of semiconductor materials for various applications is the band gap. This paper discusses automated algorithms for determining band gaps from optical absorption spectra. The algorithms are applied to a database of 34,313 optical absorption spectra, and selected results are compared to published theoretical and experimental band gap data from 16 materials sets. The best algorithm determines the band gaps with an accuracy of 0.37 eV for direct- and 0.93 eV for indirect band gaps for >20,000 spectra.}
